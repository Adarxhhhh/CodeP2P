# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vite.dev/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://vite.dev/guide/static-deploy.html) for more information.

### `npm run preview`

Locally preview the production build. Do not use this as a production server as it's not designed for it.

The command will boot up a local static web server that serves the files from `dist` at [http://localhost:4173](http://localhost:4173).
 It's an easy way to check if the production build looks OK in your local environment.
